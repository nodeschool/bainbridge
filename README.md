### Background
We own the GitHub organization, [IslandJS](https://github.com/IslandJS), which acts as a staging location for different projects used in our workshops on the island.

We also own a Meetup Page: <http://www.meetup.com/IslandJS-Nodeschool> and Domain: <http://islandjs.org>.

Finally, our Facebook community page, [IslandJS](http://www.facebook.com/IslandJS), and [Twitter Stream](https://twitter.com/island_js) also helps to support these efforts to let more people know about the group and our upcoming workshops and meetings!

## How To: Prepare for a NodeSchool meetup

##### Install Node
You can find an installer for your operating system at: https://nodejs.org/en/download/<br/>

Once installed, open a Shell, Terminal, or Command Prompt depending on your Operating System and enter the following commands to ensure you have installed everything correctly. You should see the versions of npm and node returned:<br/>
```bash
npm -v
node -v
```

##### Install your first Workshops
Once you have Node installed correctly, install the first two beginner workshops, learnyounode and javascripting:<br/>
 - For **Mac OS** and **Linux**: `sudo npm install -g learnyounode javascripting`<br/>
 - For **Windows**: Open Command Prompt as Administrator and run: `npm install -g learnyounode javascripting`
 - Verify everything installed correctly by running `learnyounode`. You will see a menu like this: <br />

There are lots of other workshops to choose from. Visit http://nodeschool.io for more information.


## Set up your development environment
The easiest way to get started is to choose a good text editor designed for development purposes. If you already have a text editor you like to use, there is no need to read further. You are now ready for NodeSchool!

Otherwise, popular text editors include: [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/3), [Atom](https://atom.io/), [Brackets](http://brackets.io/), [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/). Install any of those and we'll help you with the rest the next time we see you at a NodeSchool meetup.

## Questions, problems, advice

If you run into any issues or have questions before joining us for a meetup, feel free to open an issue: https://github.com/nodeschool/bainbridge/issues.<br />
If you have a technical issue getting Node or a Workshop installed, please be sure to include your Operating System and Node version as well to help with the troubleshooting.
